## [The importance of interactive data visualization](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz/)

The blog post points why the interactive visualization is important and how it can help us in the process
of data exploration and interpretation. It also includes a hands-on experience using the *JavaScript* library
[D3](https://d3js.org/), to code an interactive *Parallel Coordinates* plot augmented with a dynamic table to search
laptops easily.

Dataset: [Laptop Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/laptop-prices)

## [JavaScript Visualization: Discover Different Visualization Tools](/JavaScript%20Visualization%20Zoo)

A series of 4 blog posts, each discovering a different set of JavaScript visualization tools: charting, graphs, maps
and 3D.

### [First part - Charting](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-03-10-viz-tools-pt1/)
The first part covers the charting libraries with a hands-on experience with *NVD3*, *ApexCharts JS* and *Plotly JS*.

Code: [JavaScript Charting Libraries](/JavaScript%20Visualization%20Zoo/Charting)

Dataset: [Life Expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy)

### [Second Part - Graph Visualization](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-03-24-viz-tools-pt2-2/)

The second part covers the graph visualization libraries with a hands-on experience with *Cytoscape JS*.
We discuss the different graph data formats, data repositories, different *JavaScript* libraries and
out-of-the=box tools.

Code: [JavaScript Graph Visualization Libraries](/JavaScript%20Visualization%20Zoo/Graphs)

Data: [Class Dependency Network of JDK 1.6.0.7](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/subelj_jdk)

## [Random Processes in Python](/Random%20Processes)

A series of blog posts dedicated to the random processes simulation and animated visualization using the Python numerical
libraries.

### [Animated Visualization of Random Walks in Python](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-04-12-random-walk/)

Introduction of the simple random walk, simulation and animated visualization.

### [Animated Visualization of Brownian Motion in Python](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-04-16-brownian-motion/)

Introduction of the Brownian Motion, how to construct it using the simple random walk and animated visualization of this principle.

Code: [Brownian Motion Animation Pyhton Notebook](/Random%20Processes/brownian_motion_animation.ipynb)

### [Random Walks Have Never Been Funnier: Drifted Brownian Motion in Python](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-05-01-drifted-brownian-motion/)

Extending the bare Brownian Motion with volatility and drift. We illustrate these two proparties with an animated visualization using Matplotlib's Animation API. Source code:

Code: [Drifted Brownian Motion](/Random%20Processes/drifted_brownian_motion.ipynb)

### [Forget Determinism, see Randomness in Action: How to Model Stock Price](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-05-17-geometric-brownian-motion/)

Transforming the Drifted Brownian Motion from a process with additive increments to a process with multiplicative
increments. This is well suited for modelling stock price data. We analyze and animate one interesting property of
the process: for certain conditions, it has zero mean and infinite variance.
