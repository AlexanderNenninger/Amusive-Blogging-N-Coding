## [The importance of interactive data visualization](https://ilievskiv.github.io/blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz/)

The blog post points why the interactive visualization is important and how it can help us in the process
of data exploration and interpretation. It also includes a hands-on experience using the *JavaScript* library
[D3](https://d3js.org/), to code an interactive *Parallel Coordinates* plot augmented with a dynamic table to search
laptops easily.
